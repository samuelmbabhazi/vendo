/**
 * The screen agent — UI-generation blueprint §4.2 and §4.5.
 *
 * It is `vendo()` with a CLOSED loadout and a tight step budget, not a harness of
 * its own: the assembly verbs and the host's read tools by name, two hands of its
 * own, and one door out. There is no second drive of `startTurn` here — the step
 * cap, the seat resolution, `wireErrorMessage`, the history knobs and the system
 * precedence are the default harness's, so a rail cannot be fixed in one loop and
 * stay broken in the other. What this file holds is the CONFIGURATION: the brief,
 * the loadout, the hands, and the outcome the front door reads.
 *
 * - **The write path is `turn.workspace`.** The `claudeCode()` harness already
 *   builds apps this way: the model writes the app with its own hands and the
 *   runtime's commit is what makes it real (`claude-code/index.ts:338`,
 *   `skills/building-apps.ts:68`). This agent has no disk and no shell, so its two
 *   writing hands over the same `WorkspaceFs` — the whole screen, or one exact
 *   passage of it — write `app.tsx` and nothing else, through one commit path.
 * - **The run's closing words are the receipt.** The loop reports what it built in
 *   its own voice, grounded in what its saves told it: whether the paint happened,
 *   and what each query delivered. `vendo_make` relays those words verbatim
 *   (`make-receipt.ts`), so nothing downstream describes a screen it never saw.
 * - **The paint path is the render seam.** `wrapWorkspaceForRender` intercepts
 *   `commit()`, compiles, and emits `data-vendo-view`. This file never emits a
 *   view and never compiles anything — that is exactly why a screen it assembles
 *   passes the same floor a `claudeCode()` app does.
 * - **`vendo_make` is withheld, not merely unused.** The screen agent IS what
 *   `vendo_make` calls, so leaving it callable is a loop. The closed loadout
 *   excludes it by omission.
 * - **The job description is the shipped skill.** `buildingAppsSkill` plus its
 *   `references/format.md` are the same text `claudeCode()` reads. This file adds
 *   one short block that corrects the ENVIRONMENT (no disk, no delegation, one
 *   file, one door out) rather than restating the job — a third prompt is the
 *   thing §0 forbids.
 *
 * Screens run UNSANDBOXED, by §6.5: a description is data, its props are
 * schema-validated, and the kit treats them as inert. There is no box here.

standard Kit the manual documents. There is nothing else to import.${surfaceNote(input.viewport)}

- **\`${SAVE_APP_TOOL}\`** saves this app's whole file. The app is
  \`${input.appId}\`; you never name a path. Every save that parses repaints the person's
  screen, so save as you go — a save is cheap and silence is not. Every save is checked as it
  lands — if something is wrong with it, the save tells you exactly what to fix.
  It also tells you what the person's screen actually GOT: whether the save
  painted, and what each of your queries delivered.
  Its \`decisions\` is this app's MEMORY, and the only thing the next editor will
  have besides the file. Record what reading the file could not tell them — why
  you narrowed something, a constraint the tools imposed, a shape you ruled out. Never record what you did or in what order; that is narration, and
  it crowds out the one line that mattered.
- **\`${EDIT_APP_TOOL}\`** replaces one exact passage of the file you already
  saved. Fixing an error? Send an edit, not a rewrite. Quote the text that goes in
  \`find\`, write what replaces it in \`replace\`, and quote enough of it to match
  in exactly one place — everything the person is already looking at then stays
  where it is. It lands and is checked exactly like a save.
- **\`${ESCALATE_TOOL}\`** is the one door out. Writing one screen out of this
  product's components is all you can do; anything that needs real code, its own
  server, a file the person uploads, a surface these components cannot express,
  or any part that must run while nobody is watching — a schedule, a product
  event — goes through it. A view you could assemble does not keep an ask here:
  if part of it runs away from the browser, escalate the WHOLE ask. The builder
  gets the person's own ask verbatim and does its own thinking, so all you write
  is one plain sentence saying what assembly cannot do here.
- \`${steps}\` steps is this round's whole budget. Escalate rather than run out of it.

Never look for a tool that builds the app for you. There isn't one, and that is
deliberate.

## Your last words are what the person is told

When you have stopped working, say what they now have — one or two plain
sentences, in their words, and nothing else after it. Those exact words are what
the assistant repeats to them, so they can only claim what your saves reported:
what painted, and what each query delivered. If a query brought back no data or a
save never reached the screen, say that plainly instead of describing the part that
is blank.

## This product's tools your screen can CALL, but you cannot call here

The screen calls one as \`tools.<name>(args)\` from an event handler, and that is
the only way an app of yours changes anything.
