/**
 * PROOF BAR 1 — "agent → checks → slot proven end to end" (blueprint §15).
 *
 * `vendo_make` is routed through the screen agent, walked through a REAL composed
 * deployment: real store, real guard, real apps pack, the real render seam, the
 * real checks floor. Nothing on either side of the seam is stubbed except the
 * MODEL, which is scripted so the routing — not a provider's mood — is what this
 * measures.
 *
 * The two things a stub could hide, and why they are asserted here rather than in
 * `packages/harnesses`:
 *
 * 1. **The row.** The gauntlet's own paint is what makes a written file an APP:
 *    without it a screen is a picture of one — absent from the person's list,
 *    masked as `not-found` by `vendo_apps_open`. Only a real store can prove it
 *    landed.
 * 2. **The empty answer.** Assembly that produces nothing renderable ends the ask
 *    with a failed receipt, and "nothing else ran" is not something a
 *    harness-level test can claim: it needs the real front door.
 *
 * THE ARTIFACT is `app.tsx` (`SCREEN_FILE`) — one React component the model wrote,
 * which the floor's own component gauntlet compiles, scans, type-checks, runs in
 * the sealed VM and tree-checks before anything paints. Nothing below stubs that
 * gauntlet: these screens go through the real five stages of a real composed
 * deployment, which is why a screen naming a tool this host has not got paints
 * nothing.
