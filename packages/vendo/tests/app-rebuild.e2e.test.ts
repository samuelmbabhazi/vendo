/**
 * The rebuildability proof — contract §2.2/§2.3, Track B's done bar.
 *
 * "The code lives in your database like everything else, and the box is
 * disposable." Before this, an app built in a box existed only inside the E2B
 * snapshot behind `machine.snapshotRef`: lose the snapshot and the customer's app
 * is gone, because the store never had it. `doc.source` demotes that ref to a
 * CACHE — and the only way to know it really is one is to DELETE the snapshot and
 * rebuild the app without it.
 *
 * So this is a seam test with no stub on either side (repo CLAUDE.md's testing
 * law). Every piece is the shipped one:
 *
 *   - the real PGlite store, and the real `workspaceStore(store, { files })` façade
 *   - the real `wrapWorkspaceForRender` commit interception, wired the way
 *     `server.ts` wires it: `commitSource: (input) => apps.commitSource(input, ctx)`
 *   - the real `createApps` runtime behind that verb, so ownership, the
 *     compare-and-swap update and the blob spill are the production ones
 *   - a fake `SandboxAdapter` whose snapshot is genuinely destroyed, so `resume`
 *     genuinely fails and the test cannot pass on a snapshot that is still there
 *
 * The live-box half of the bar (a real E2B box, really re-served) belongs to the
 * builder track; this half proves the STORAGE: what a rebuild has to read.

/**
 * "Unreadable" and "deleted" are not the same fact — coordinator ruling,
 * 2026-08-05, on freshly-merged `app-source.ts`.
 *
 * `commitApp` decided deletions by whether the read-back threw. For a spilled file
 * that read is a LIVE FETCH from the files adapter, so a blob store having a bad
 * minute looked exactly like "the user deleted this" and the entry was dropped from
 * `doc.source`. With this PR making the row the app's only home, that is the lost
 * app the whole change exists to prevent.
 *
 * The discriminator is `exists()`, not the error: it answers from the row index and
 * never touches the blob. The thrown error CANNOT be the discriminator — the façade
 * raises the same POSIX-shaped `ENOENT` for a deleted row as for a row whose bytes
 * have gone missing (`workspace-rows.ts` `load()` returning undefined →
 * `workspace-fs.ts` `bytesOf` → `enoent`), and it carries no code to switch on.
 *
 * Both directions are asserted. Survival alone would pass on code that simply never
 * deletes anything.
