/**
 * ONE briefing pack, two rungs, the same bytes.
 *
 * The spec's promise is that the product knowledge a writer gets does not depend
 * on WHICH writer answered: a screen the assembly loop wrote and an app the box
 * built are the same product to the person who asked. Before this, the two rungs
 * were told different things — the screen agent got the theme, the design rules
 * and the tool shape card and never saw `.vendo/brief.md` at all; the in-box
 * builder got none of them. Neither gap could be seen from the outside, which is
 * exactly why it survived.
 *
 * So this measures the two prompts THEMSELVES, on one real composed deployment:
 * a real `createVendo`, the real screen agent, a real escalation, and a box that
 * behaves like a box (a control port answering the `/agent/task` long-poll). The
 * scripted model and the sandbox PROVIDER are the only two things faked, and
 * neither of them is a side of the seam under test — the producer
 * (`compose-surfaces.ts`) and both consumers are real.
 *
 * Two assertions carry it, and they pull in opposite directions on purpose:
 *   - the briefing pack is byte-identical in both prompts (`toBe`), and
 *   - the INSTRUCTIONS around it are not, because the screen agent's dialect
 *     manual and the box's skin contract are different jobs. Prompts that were
 *     identical all the way through would mean the per-rung split collapsed.
