/**
 * The reference is documentation a MODEL copies from, so its worked screen is
 * tested the way code is: it goes through the REAL save-time gauntlet
 * (`checkComponentScreen` — esbuild, the import/query scan, the type check
 * against the generated declarations, and one actual render in the QuickJS VM),
 * with nothing stubbed but the host's own tools.
 *
 * A reference that teaches a screen the checks reject is worse than no reference
 * — the model follows it, the save fails, and the model has no way to learn
 * which of the two was wrong.
 *
 * The wire-dialect halves of this file went with the dialect: a screen is
 * `app.tsx` now (`contract/genui/component/types.ts` SCREEN_FILE), so there is
 * no `<Plan>`/`<App>` markup, no closed expression-call vocabulary and no
 * reshape pipe left in the reference to check.
