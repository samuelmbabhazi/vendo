/**
 * The `validate` VERB runs the whole floor — blueprint §7.1 item 3.
 *
 * The door was built with `createCheckingLayer({ deps, checks: config.checks })`
 * and nothing else, so it ran the seven deterministic fact checks and the host's
 * own plugged checks and SKIPPED the AI reviewer. `create` and `edit` ran it (via
 * `conductor.ts`'s `checkingFor`); the door did not. So the building-apps skill
 * teaches "validate after every edit — it is faster and surer than re-reading your
 * own work", and the thing it taught could not see invented data, dishonest tool
 * use, dead controls, dropped work, or a single one of the host's own judgment
 * rules. Half a checker answering "ok" is the worst lie a checker can tell.
 *
 * The reviewer stays FAIL-OPEN here, exactly as it is everywhere else: silence, a
 * refusal to call the tool, and a failed request all mean "no findings", and the
 * layer's crash guard degrades a throw to a `warn`. A reviewer that could not judge
 * must never be the reason a good app is refused — and must never turn a `validate`
 * into a tool error either, because an error reads to a model as "the tool is
 * broken" while findings read as "your document is wrong".
