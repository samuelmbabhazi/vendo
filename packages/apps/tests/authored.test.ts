 * Build contract §1.6 / redesign D4 — a FILES-FIRST app is a first-class app.
 *
 * The live E2E defect this closes (2026-08-03): the claude-code harness wrote
 * `app.vendo` with its own hands, the render seam painted it, and nothing else
 * ever happened — no store row, so the app was absent from the person's list and
 * `vendo_apps_open` masked it as `not-found`, and no query ever ran, so every
 * value on screen read "—" while the host data sat one call away.
 *
 * `AppsRuntime.authored` is the one door that closes both halves, and these are
 * its rules: the row lands through the SAME writer generation persists with, the
 * queries run through the SAME guard-bound caller `open()` resolves with (so a
 * query the policy gates contributes nothing, exactly like an app's own read),
 * and an app that already exists keeps everything that is its own history.
