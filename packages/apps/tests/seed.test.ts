/**
 * Remix as a seeded app (06-apps §8).
 *
 * A remix is not a subsystem: it is a create that starts from something that
 * already existed. After the re-platform it is also not a COPY — the ✦ gesture
 * collects an instruction, records where the remix came from, and runs that
 * instruction through the ordinary edit door. What lands is an ordinary screen
 * app (`app.tsx`, the same artifact every other screen is), so there is no
 * captured host source in the document and nothing evaluates any.
 *
 * That single fact retires the two proofs this file used to carry — the island
 * gate's by-name exemption for a seeded seat, and the seat holding its own jail
 * furnishings. Both existed to make the host's own bytes runnable inside a
 * remix. Nothing runs them now, so what is asserted below is that nothing
 * carries them either.
