/**
 * The honest-refusal law on the QUERY path (06-apps §1–2).
 *
 * "Data didn't load — that isn't your data being empty" shipped on 2026-08-03 as
 * a payload marker the renderer shows. It could only ever be set by the render
 * seam, and only when the whole app half THREW — which is the rare failure. The
 * common one is a query that answered: an error from the host, a `blocked` or
 * `connect-required` refusal from the guard. Those resolve to no data, every
 * binding under them renders "—", and the view told the person they have no
 * spending. `open()` — the path every stored app opens through — could not set
 * the marker at all.
 *
 * So: whoever RAN the queries and watched them fail says so, and nobody else can
 * (a document field is stripped, and a host venue hook cannot mint one either).
 * An empty result is NOT a failure — claiming it is would be the same lie in
 * reverse.
