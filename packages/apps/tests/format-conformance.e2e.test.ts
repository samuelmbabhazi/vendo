/**
 * THE FORMAT CONSTITUTION.
 *
 * The app format has mirrors — the contract, `@vendoai/core`'s pinned limits,
 * the manual the model reads (`skills/format-reference.ts`) and the public docs
 * page. Every one of them used to be maintained by hand, and they disagreed: the
 * manual promised "16 islands, 64 KB each" and never mentioned the 256 KB TOTAL
 * the validator also enforces, so a model that obeyed the manual could write a
 * megabyte of islands and watch the whole app fail to validate for a reason it
 * was never told about.
 *
 * The manual is no longer one of those mirrors for the byte budgets: a screen is
 * `app.tsx` now and has no byte budget, so what is asserted of the manual here is
 * that it quotes none. The budgets themselves still bind a stored component map
 * (`contract/component-map.ts`), so core, the contract and the docs page still
 * have to agree.
 *
 * This file is the one place a format number or a component name is written by
 * hand. Everything else derives, and this test fails the moment any mirror
 * drifts from another — a test, not a convention.
