    description: "Make the user something to look at — a screen, or a full app — from a plain-language request. Say what they want in your own words; Vendo decides whether to assemble a screen or build an app, and it arrives on the user's own page. Pass `app` only to change one specific existing app — its id, or its name exactly as the user said it, which is resolved against their own apps (if two share that name you are told both, so ask which one); leave it out and Vendo decides whether to continue the last one or start something new. A recurring or scheduled task belongs here too: describe the schedule and the action in the request and it is armed as part of the same call; there is no separate automations tool. One app can hold SEVERAL automations, so to add another one to an app it already has, name that app in `app` and describe the new schedule — never refuse a second schedule. Never bake data values you computed or fetched (counts, totals, amounts) into the request — it binds live host data itself and hardcoded figures fail its checks. Never specify fonts, colors, or branding — it inherits the host theme. You get back a one-line receipt to say out loud, never the screen itself; if the receipt says \"failed\", try once more on the same `app` with a narrower request rather than rebuilding it, and if it says \"partial\" the screen is on their page but the server-side part of it is not — say the line and offer to try that part again, never rebuild it. Pass `slot` only when the request names a particular place on the user's page for it to land — the host publishes those slot ids, so pass one you were told rather than one you invented, and whatever held that place is replaced. `slot` is for something NEW: to move an app that already exists, use the pin tool instead.",
