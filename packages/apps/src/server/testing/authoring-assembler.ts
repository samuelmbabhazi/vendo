 * exact write path the shipped render seam uses, so the row, the history entry,
 * the guard decision and the query resolution are all the real ones. The only
 * thing standing in for a live agent is the choice of document.
 *
 * `answer` is handed the request the runtime made and the app as it stands

 * screen agent opens the document, rewrites it and saves the whole thing, and a
 * fixture that reads `current` does the same.
