const CHAPTER = `# The screen file

An app is ONE file — \`${APP_FILE}\`, in the app's own directory
\`user/apps/app_<name>/\` — holding a React component, default-exported. Saving it
repaints the person's screen.

\`\`\`tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { useQuery, tools, Stack, Text, Button } from "@vendo/screen";

export default function Overview() { … }
\`\`\`

Those two imports are everything there is. Nothing else can be loaded.

**Data — \`useQuery("tool_name")\`.** Synchronous, and it hands back the tool's
result exactly as the tool returns it, so read the field names off the tool's own
schema. Money arrives in whatever unit that schema says: divide a \`_cents\` field
by 100 where you read it, because the components format and never convert.

**Actions — \`tools.<tool_name>(args)\`, inside an event handler only.** Never
during render. \`await\` it when you need the result; the host runs the tool and
answers. When an awaited call succeeds, every \`useQuery\` on the screen re-runs
and the screen re-renders with fresh data on its own — so never patch state to
mirror what the refresh will bring back. Destructive and money-moving calls are
confirmed by the product OUTSIDE your screen — the guard asks the person before
the call runs — so never build a confirm step of your own: no "are you sure"
panel, no second button, no \`confirming\` state.

**Components — the catalog below, and nothing else.** Every component already
carries this product's own theme, so anything with behavior — a table, a number,
a date, a control — is a component, never HTML you assemble yourself.

**Layout — the display tags, plus \`style\`.** \`${DISPLAY_TAG_NAMES.join("`, `")}\`
are yours to arrange with, and they take children and an inline \`style\` and
nothing else: no \`className\`, no \`id\`, no handlers. Style them off the host's own
CSS variables (\`var(--vendo-color-accent)\`, \`var(--vendo-density-content-gap)\`)
so the screen stays branded — a hard-coded color is your color, not the
product's. There is no network in here, so a style that fetches (\`url(…)\`) is
dropped.
\`key={…}\` on every row you \`.map\`. Dates go to the date
component as the ISO string you were given — there is no clock in here, so no
\`new Date()\`; and no \`fetch\`, \`localStorage\` or \`setTimeout\` either, because
there is no network, no storage and no timers.

**State — \`useState\`.** Inputs are controlled: \`value={x}\` with
\`onChange={(e) => setX(e.target.value)}\`. A handler receives a plain
\`{ target: { value } }\` — a checkbox, \`{ target: { checked } }\` — and there is no
\`preventDefault\` to call: \`<Form>\` submits itself.

Save errors tell you exactly what to fix. Fix and save again.

## One worked screen, end to end

The ask: "let me cancel a transfer before it goes out."

\`\`\`tsx
import { Button, Card, DateTime, Money, Row, Stack, Text, tools, useQuery } from "@vendo/screen";

export default function PendingTransfers() {
  const pending = useQuery("list_pending_transfers");

  return (
    <Stack gap={12}>
      <Text text="Transfers waiting to go out" variant="heading" />

      {pending.data.length === 0 ? (
        <Text text="Nothing is waiting to go out." variant="caption" />
      ) : (
        pending.data.map((transfer) => (
          <Card key={transfer.id} title={transfer.recipient}>
            <Row justify="between" align="center">
              <Stack gap={4}>
                <Money amount={transfer.amount_cents / 100} />
                <DateTime value={transfer.scheduled_for} mode="date" />
              </Stack>
              <Button label="Cancel" variant="danger" onClick={() => tools.cancel_transfer({ id: transfer.id })} />
            </Row>
          </Card>
        ))
      )}
    </Stack>
  );
}
\`\`\`

Nothing on that screen is typed in: every value is read off the query, every
number and date is formatted by the component showing it, the empty list says so
in one honest line, and the one thing that changes the product files its call
straight from the press — the product does the asking.

---

## Components

Host components come first when one fits: they are this product's own, already
branded. One file each, with the full props schema and examples:
\`host/components/<Name>.md\`, relative to the directory you are working in.
\`search_components\` finds one by intent when you do not know the name.

Everything below ships with the format and is available in every screen. The prop
names and types are exact — an unknown prop fails the checks.
