/**
 * The save-time gauntlet for a COMPONENT screen — the new artifact: one plain
 * `.tsx` file, one default-exported React component, data through
 * `useQuery("tool_name", {literal input}?)`, actions through
 * `tools.tool_name(args)` inside handlers, and nothing imported but `react` and
 * `@vendo/screen`.
 *
 * Five stages, and the order is not a preference: a file that does not compile
 * has no AST to scan; a scan that cannot name the queries has no plan to
 * type-check against; and a screen that does not type-check must never be
 * EXECUTED. So each stage is the next one's precondition and the first one that
 * finds something is the last one that runs.
 *
 *   1. COMPILE   esbuild, once per form (the CJS the engine evaluates, the
 *                module form the scan reads).
 *   2. SCAN      the two rules a compiler cannot state: the import surface is
 *                exactly two modules, and every query names a read tool with a
 *                literal name and a literal input. Plus the `tools` discipline —
 *                literal member access, called from a handler, never mid-render.
 *   3. TYPECHECK the real compiler, against declarations derived from the Kit's
 *                zod specs and the host tools' own schemas, with NO DOM lib —
 *                so `document`, `fetch` and `<div>` are errors because they
 *                genuinely do not exist here.
 *   4. RUN ONCE  execute the query plan for real, boot the screen on the answers,
 *                take its tree.
 *   5. TREE      the tree validators the wire artifact already ships.
 *
 * Every issue is written as a repair instruction. These messages are read by a
 * model, and a refusal that does not say what to write instead only costs a
 * round.
 *
 * The `.vendo` document checks (facts.ts) are untouched — this is the parallel
 * gauntlet for the new artifact, and it REUSES their machinery rather than
 * restating it: the same esbuild pattern, the same schema→TS printers
 * (screen-typings.ts), the same compiler harness (screen-tsc.ts), the same
 * `tools` literal-access scan (contract/island-ambient.ts), the same tree
 * validators (contract/genui/tree.ts + facts.ts), the same reviewer data
 * discipline (reviewer.ts).

 * A `namespace` block, off the AUTHOR's source — the module form cannot answer

 * output form for one at all, so by the time there is a parsed module the
 * construct is gone either way.
 *
 * Text matching is therefore the only reading available, and it is written to
 * fail CLOSED: `\s` on both sides so a brace on the next line still counts, and
 * a non-identifier lookbehind rather than a line anchor so `const x = 1;
 * namespace Foo {` is seen — those were misses, and a guard that misses admits
 * the very screen it exists to catch.
 *
 * The residual runs the other way, and it is the WHOLE of the author's file:
 * this reads raw text, so the words `namespace X {` are refused wherever they
 * appear — in a line comment, in a block comment, in a string, in a template
 * literal, in JSX text. Nothing here strips any of those, and a screen that
 * merely SAYS the construct is refused as if it declared one. That is the
 * accepted price: unlike the `static {}` guard, no AST can answer this, because
 * every toolchain erases the construct before there is a tree to read. A false
 * refusal costs one repair round on a screen nobody writes; a miss ships a
 * screen that paints differently in two venues. `scan-fidelity.test.ts` pins
 * this behaviour deliberately, so that closing it cannot silently reopen the
 * `namespace Foo\n{` miss.
 *
 * One residual runs the OTHER way and is accepted on the same terms: `\s` does
 * not match a comment, so a REAL declaration with a block comment between the
 * keyword, the name or the brace is admitted — those shapes pass the whole
 * gauntlet, which is a miss and not a false refusal. The
 * only fix is lexing the file to read through comments, and this guard exists
 * precisely because there is no parse of the construct to lean on. Pinned in the
 * same place as the false positives, so the accepted set is honest in both
 * directions.
