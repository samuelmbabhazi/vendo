/**
 * Stage 3's translation: one compiled screen's diagnostics as repair
 * instructions.
 *
 * Split out of the gauntlet because it travels with the COMPILER, not with the
 * gate. Every sentence here is written off the AST — the node under a
 * diagnostic, the resolved signature of the call around it, the tag of the
 * element it sits in — and an AST walk cannot cross a service binding. So a
 * toolchain that type-checks somewhere else translates there too, and both run
 * THIS translation: a screen author reads the same sentence whatever compiled
 * the screen.
 *
 * Only the classes whose prose is specific to this dialect are written here —
 * the surface is two modules, there is no DOM, and a tool payload is a schema.
 * Everything else is handed to the wire screen's own translator (screen-tsc.ts),
 * which already says the right thing about props, arguments and missing fields.
