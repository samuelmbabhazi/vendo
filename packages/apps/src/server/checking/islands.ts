 *  under Vitest's vm-sandboxed test runner, unlike a `new Function`-built
 *  indirection, which throws ERR_VM_DYNAMIC_IMPORT_CALLBACK_MISSING there).

 *  specific specifier at build time instead of walking into esbuild's
 *  package — which is where the real damage happens: esbuild's own
 *  lib/main.js resolves its native binary with a dynamic require, and once a
 *  bundler is inside esbuild's module graph at all, it tries to parse the
 *  platform binary and its README.md as JS and hard-fails the build.
 *  Confirmed empirically: without these comments (or `serverExternalPackages:
 *  ["esbuild"]` in the host's next.config), `next build` on a host importing
 *  "@vendoai/vendo/server" fails with "Unknown module type" /
 *  "invalid utf-8 sequence" on esbuild's platform binary; with them, the
 *  same host builds clean with esbuild left OUT of `serverExternalPackages`
 *  entirely. */
