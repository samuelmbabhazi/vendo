/**
 * Schema-derived TypeScript declarations for one screen — the static half of
 * the checks floor.
 *
 * The floor already knows every type a screen file can name: the Kit's props
 * are zod (`core` `kit/specs.ts`), a host component's props are the JSON Schema
 * derived once at composition (`NormalizedCatalogEntry.propsJsonSchema`), and a
 * query's result is the tool's declared `outputSchema`. This module turns all
 * of that into ambient declaration text so `tsc` — the real compiler, not a
 * bespoke walker — decides whether a screen names components that exist, sets
 * props that exist with types that fit, reaches fields the data really carries,
 * and aggregates over field names the rows really have.
 *
 * Everything here is DERIVED. No hand-written component list, no hand-written
 * prop list: the component vocabulary comes from `KIT_SCREEN_COMPONENT_NAMES` + the
 * catalog. There is no CALL vocabulary to declare any more — a `{...}` gap is a
 * JavaScript expression, so `invoices.data.reduce((t, r) => t + r.amount, 0)`
 * type-checks against the query's own declared result type with nothing
 * ambient in the way. The old `sum`/`count`/`group_by`/`pick` declarations
 * existed only to give tsc a shape for a closed dialect that no longer exists;
 * shipping them now would type-check calls the renderer cannot evaluate.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic: same input, byte-identical output. No compiler, no
 * I/O — {@link screenTscFindings} in screen-tsc.ts is the half that runs one.
