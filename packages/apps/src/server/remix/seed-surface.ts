/**
 * `AppsRuntime.seed` — remix provenance as an ordinary app.
 *
 * A remix is not a subsystem. It is a `create` that starts from something that
 * already existed, so this module is thin on purpose: it finds the captured
 * baseline, records what the person asked for, and hands the ordinary edit door
 * the instruction. Standard validation, standard edit path, standard history.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE: a bare fork. Nothing copies the captured source
 * into the minted app and nothing evaluates one — the ✦ gesture collects an
 * INSTRUCTION first, and fork plus first edit are ONE operation whose output is a
 * REGULAR SCREEN (`app.tsx`, through the ordinary edit door). The captured
 * baseline is provenance: what the remix started from, and what a re-seed
 * replays the recorded instruction against.
